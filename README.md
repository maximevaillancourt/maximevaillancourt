Hi! I'm Maxime. I'm a senior software developer at [Shopify](https://www.shopify.ca/), where I work on storefront performance. ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦

âœ¨ Outside of work, Iâ€™m building [freshreader.app](https://freshreader.app/), a way to get rid of those 82 open tabs you have but know you'll never read. I'm also building [turven.xyz](https://turven.xyz/), a real-time visitor counter that you can insert on your website (what's that sound? that's the 2000s calling, they want their hit counters back).

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to take better notes, as part of my [digital garden](https://maximevaillancourt.com/notes).

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about the joy of riding a bicycle in the winter, my short stint as a DJ in university, or why you should have your own personal website.

âš¡ Fun fact: I can dislocate my left shoulder on demand. It's... not gross at all. ðŸ˜…

ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him
