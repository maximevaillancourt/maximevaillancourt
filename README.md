Hi! I'm Maxime. I'm a senior software developer at [Shopify](https://www.shopify.ca/) where I work on storefront performance. ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦

âœ¨ Outside of work, Iâ€™m building [freshreader.app](https://freshreader.app/), a way to get rid of those 82 open tabs you have but know you'll never read.

ðŸ“º I'm just starting to livestream as I work on side projects. If that sounds like something you'd like to watch, [join me on Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/maximevaillancourt)!

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to take better notes, as part of my [digital garden](https://maximevaillancourt.com/notes).

ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him

ðŸ“« How to reach me: DMs are open on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/vaillancourtmax), please introduce yourself! :wave:
